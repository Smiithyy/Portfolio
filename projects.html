						<p>In this exciting island defense game, you are tasked with defending your island from waves of
							attacking pirate ships. Using cutting-edge voice recognition, you control a powerful cannon
							to
							fend off the invaders. Aim, fire, and reload your cannon entirely through voice commands,
							making
							for a unique and immersive experience. As you progress, the pirate ships grow more
							aggressive,
							and the waves become increasingly difficult, challenging your reflexes and strategy. Created
							in
							Unity using C#, this game combines dynamic gameplay with intuitive voice controls to keep
							you on
							your toes. How long can you survive the pirate assault? The longer you last, the tougher the
							battle becomes—are you ready to defend your island?<br /> <br />
							Voice commands used in gameplay demo: <br>
							Fire, Turn Right, Fire, Full Left, Fire, Turn Right, Fire, Reload, Turn Right, Fire, Full
							Left, Fire, Turn Right

						<p>This Unreal Engine 5 project features a fully functional Souls-like combat system, developed
							entirely using UE5's Blueprints Visual Scripting. Designed for developers looking to
							implement challenging, strategic combat mechanics without deep coding knowledge, this system
							offers a fluid and engaging player experience. With a focus on action-packed combat and
							resource management, this scalable system is ideal for building immersive action RPGs,
							dungeon crawlers, or other combat-focused games.

						<ul>
							<h3>Key Features:</h3>
							<li>Attack Combos: Players can execute a variety of attack combinations by chaining light
								and
								heavy strikes. The combo system is easy to expand or modify, allowing developers to
								create
								unique combat styles for different player characters or enemies.</li>
							<li>Health and Stamina Systems: The project features a well-balanced health and stamina
								management system, requiring players to carefully balance offensive and defensive
								actions.
								Stamina depletes as players sprint, dodge, or attack, adding an extra layer of strategy
								to
								the combat flow.</li>
							<li>Sprinting: Sprinting mechanics are integrated into the player movement, enabling rapid
								movement during exploration or to close gaps in combat. The stamina system is linked to
								sprinting, making resource management essential for success in longer encounters.
							<li>Dodge-Rolls: A responsive dodge-roll mechanic allows players to evade enemy attacks,
								providing a critical defensive option in high-stakes combat. The roll can be seamlessly
								integrated with attack combos, allowing players to chain defensive and offensive actions
								fluidly.</li>
							<li>Jumping: The jumping system adds verticality to both movement and combat. Players can
								leap
								over obstacles, avoid certain enemy attacks, and perform aerial combat actions. This
								feature
								enhances the combat depth, providing more tactical options during encounters.</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Scalability:</h3>
						The system is designed to be scalable and flexible, easily integrated into projects of any
						size. It provides a foundation for combat mechanics that can be expanded with additional
						moves, abilities, or complex AI behavior. Developers can modify or extend the core features
						using UE5's Blueprint system, tailoring the combat flow and mechanics to fit specific
						gameplay needs, whether for smaller indie games or larger-scale RPGs. Its modular design
						makes it simple to tweak individual systems (such as combos, stamina, or dodging) without
						disrupting other elements, providing full customization based on game requirements.<br><br>

						<h3>Built Entirely in Blueprints:</h3>
						This project leverages Unreal Engine’s powerful Blueprint Visual Scripting system, ensuring
						a user-friendly, no-code solution that is both accessible and efficient. By using
						Blueprints, developers can easily understand, adjust, and enhance the combat mechanics,
						without needing deep programming knowledge. The system is optimized for smooth performance
						and easy integration, with clear modular components that can be adjusted or extended to fit
						any game project.<br><br>

						This Souls-like combat system is a robust and versatile framework for developers looking to
						create a challenging and rewarding combat experience in Unreal Engine 5, while also offering
						the flexibility to scale and customize based on project needs<br /> <br />
